### PI Words

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eyetracker/ps1_PI_words_generation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eyetracker/ps1_PI_words_generation)

My first project for learning test driven development using NEW tools for me:

 - py.test
 - TravisCI
 - Tox
 - sphinx
 - readthedocs

This is my personal solution to a deliberately unnamed computer engineering course. The underlying program is named **PI_Words**, which will be developed with **Python 3.3**.
